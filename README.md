## Form Validation
For Assignment 2, we are validating the Login and Registration Forms on the server-side.

In order to accomplish this task, I used the body-parser middleware. Here is the npm command
that we used to install body-parser middleware:
> $ npm install body-parser

And then we implement the following code in our entry-point file
>  const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

## Sendgrid - Email on Registration
For this assignment, we used the SendGrid API to send emails to the client
upon Registering on the website.
